# OpenSourceUniversity
This is a placeholder repo for a potential online University that seeks to fix the issues of 'the system' of college

## MVP Features
A list of desired MVP features that I wish to include before release to the public

### Courses
Obviously we will need a bit of content (and by a bit, I mean a lot), from all over. Blogs, tutorials, and legitimate professor-level teachings--We're trying to be an accredited school after all--But outside of the courses themselves, I will need a few things:

* **A Video Dashboard**
    * Most useful for viewing course progress and watching videos in a nice UI
* **Easy access to professors**
    * A third party integration, or a full-fledged solution, probably the former for MVP
* **A non-traditional grading system**
    * Most of my motivation for this is to subvert the norms of college, and I think that starts with grading. I think PluralSight IQ does a good job of evaluating skill in a similar fashion to how I might do this. Weekly or semi-monthly evaluations of the progress of a student (thru questions or quizes) taken online. MVP should include multiple-choice questions graded by machine, where the stretch may well include essays graded by hand and machine
* **Anti-cheat implementation**
    * This will need to exist to solve the very real issue of plagiarism and enforce student integritity. All answers will be stored in a database as history, so in time there will be an extensive library to compare against. For MVP, a possible solution could be a curated test-taking environment or a screen share (if the students of V1 aren't that numerous)
